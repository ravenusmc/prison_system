# Prison
## Intro

In the Spring of 2018, I am/was taking a PHP and SQL course. For my SQL course, we had to make a project modeling a prison. We have to create all of the tables for the prison and design the schema. I actually enjoyed doing the project and thus, I decided to turn that project into a web project. I thought that it would be a good way to learn PHP better and it's a project that I may be working on for a while!
